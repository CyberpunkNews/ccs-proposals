# Summary

This proposal is a funding request by Cyberpunk. It requests **1,420 PART per PART value target achieved** from the Particl community and team for a period of **estimated PART value target achievements only,** after which Cyberpunk will submit a new funding request proposal.

# Rationale

Cyberpunk is currently operating without funding and voluntarily as a hobby. This makes it incredibly complicated for Cyberpunk to execute his ideas and expand its operations, new relationships, communication, and marketing initiatives to benefit Particl community and ecosystem. This funding request serves as a solution to these problems. 
Funding by the Particl community and team will provide freedom of action dependent only on PART value appreciation.

**Cyberpunk is requesting 1,420 PART coins per PART value target achievement from the Particl community (team included) to fund Cyberpunk development of investor and speculator acquisition. The request covers all basic expenses for the estimated PART value achievement.**

## Funding Distribution

The funds claimed by Cyberpunk will be used for various purposes. The Cyberpunk intends to use these resources to strategically attract new investors, speculators and users to the ecosystem; and improve brand awareness. Proposal PART funds will only be distributed over-the-counter (OTC) or used as peer-to-peer payments to various service providers. 

Here are a few key points that provide more information about this initiative.

* **Linkedin** - investor relations & strategic communications. 
	
	Key performance indicator - over 2 years acquired over ~1,400 institutional investor network. Had PM interaction with most connections. Main objective is to establish a healthy over-the-counter (OTC) market for PART digital asset. 

* **Memes** - production of image and video memes. 
	
	Key performance indicator - Cyberpunk produced a lot of Particl - related image and video assets. Had many inquiries from Particl community members to manage Particl official social media channels (not an objective).

* **Other** - increasing brand awareness across various digital channels are key elements for driving online searches. It's important to have a constant flow of introductions to Particl everywhere possible. 

	Key performance indicator - manages a range of digital media channels and embed digital approaches to marketing and communications.

# Risk Assessment/Management

All forms of capital investment are invariably associated with a certain risk. All projects are planned for the future and are likely to be altered to a larger or smaller extent; therefore, they are inevitably bound by uncertainty and risk. Every project task is affected by some sort of risk, which can cause deviation from the planned course of execution and actual schedules.

Risks for proposal contributors are mitigated by proposed PART value milestone achievements. Successful Cyberpunk work should reflect a positive PART value and volume increase. When a certain milestone is achieved funds should be unlocked to ensure successful proposal execution. 

# Force Majeure

If the performance of this proposal cannot be continued due to force majeure, Cyberpunk may be exempted from liabilities in whole or in part according to the impact of force majeure. If Cyberpunk cannot perform this Proposal Agreement due to force majeure, it shall immediately notify proposal contributors, try its best to minimize the possible losses to proposal contributors, and shall timely provide communications.
